## ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Publishing new or modified BC Geographic Warehouse objects requires coordination between multiple partners including DataBC staff, the contractor involved, and the project’s business analyst. Please refer to [_Data Publication: Roles and Responsibilities_](dsg_bcgw_roles_and_responsibilities.md) for a description of the roles and responsibilities of each of these partners.

-----------------------

## DATA DELIVERY CHECKLIST

In preparation for a deployment, following activities must have been addressed and completed.

### Whiteboard Meeting(s) Held

Under normal circumstances one or two whiteboard meetings are required:

1. "Discovery" whiteboard meeting
   + Where the data suppliers provide an overview of the data and their intent for access purposes via DataBC Services. 
1. "Technical" whiteboard meeting 
   + Where the vendor provide information for Dataset Logfile creation/review/sign-off. 

**Responsibility of**: DataBC project lead spatial data administrator  

### Dataset Logfile Completed and Reviewed

The main output of the technical whiteboard meeting is an approved dataset logfile which summarizes business details, security requirements, data volumes, attributes and their data types / definitions, classification, and Open Data processes (if applicable).

+ [_Dataset Logfile_](dps_bcgw_w.md#dataset-logfile)

**Responsibility of**: Vendor delivery personnel and  DataBC project lead spatial data administrator

### Data Delivery Loading Accounts Created and Verified

In most cases, Vendors delivering data to the BCGW Delivery environment will already have necessary accounts in place. The following accounts are normally required but not in all cases:

1. **IDIR** – Required for accessing government infrastructure, Gogs to load the Delivery Kit, access standards, email, etc.
1. **VPN** – Required in order to complete the Logical and Physical data models in Oracle Designer - steps that must be complete prior to delivering.
1. **GTS** (GIS Terminal Server) – Access to ArcGIS, FME, and Oracle SQL Developer; access to BCGW Delivery (Read and Write), Test (Read only), and Production (Read only); access is also possible to DBC Delivery, Test, and Production (application instance for non-data system components). See [this link](https://nrm.sp.gov.bc.ca/sites/AGRI/gtsusersforum/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/GTS%20Best%20Practices/Forms/AllItems.aspx) (login required) for GTS Best Practices.
1. **BCGW** – An Oracle account is required in order to log in to BCGW Delivery, Test, or Production. Access can be request via the [NRS Service Desk](https://nrsservicedesk.gov.bc.ca).
1. **Modelling Repository** - Access to start modelling into DataBC's Repository to complete Logical and Physical data models. Access can be request via the [DataBC Data Architecture Services](mailto:databc.da@gov.bc.ca) team.
1. **Gogs Repository** – Each delivery requires that a Gogs repository to be in place. The vendor’s IDIR account is granted read / write permission on the directory. The Gogs repository is where the completed Delivery Kit is pulled for use by the DataBC Delivery Specialist to deploy in Test and Production.
1. **Schema Owner** – In order to deploy objects in Delivery, the Vendor must know the Schema Owner user name and password for the Delivery environment. Should the credentials be unknown, please contact the [DataBC Data Architecture Services](mailto:databc.da@gov.bc.ca) Team to gain access to them in the delivery environment

** Note:** If accounts are not in place, contact the [DataBC Data Architecture Services](mailto:databc.da@gov.bc.ca) Team to make arrangements. Account creation can take two **(2)** work weeks.

**Responsibility of**: DataBC project lead spatial data administrator

### Repository Container Checkout List Completed

In order for a new data modelling exercise to commence, a container checkout request needs to be completed, addressing the questions below and submitted to the DataBC Data Architecture Services Team (some details will need to be provided by the _DataBC DA_):

1. Name of Repository Container needing work: XXX_WHSE
1. Patch number associated with Container work: X.X.X
1. Name of DataBC DA responsible for checking the Contractor work
1. Name of Contractor performing the work
1. A complete list of what and how each of the entities, including their fields, will be modified.
   + _Creation/Update_ of the following dataset(s) and _Access Config_:  
   
	|Table Name|WebMapping|Dist|Pop|Open Data|Metadata|
	|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
	|`table name`|`security`|`security`|`frequency`|`yes candidate no tbd`|`New or existing`|

   + _ADD_ Fields (used for small data model changes):
   + _REMOVE_ Fields(used for small data model changes):
   + _REPLACE_ Objects:
6. What is the [_Gogs Repository_](https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/placeholder)?
7. What is the associated JIRA DWACT number (DWACT-xxxx)? 

**Responsibility of**: Vendor delivery personnel

### Oracle Designer Repository Container Created if Necessary

If an existing container does not meet specific needs, a new one can be created. The example below illustrates what the DataBC Data Architecture Team expect in terms of definitions as part of the checkout approval process:

1. **Container name:** FNSOC\_WHSE
1. **Description:** The FNSOC\_WHSE store objects that relate to preliminary Strength of Claim (SOC) assessments undertaken by agencies in the natural resource sector; as required when discharging the Provinces duty to consult with first nations. The data requires named-user level security restrictions. This container holds spatial and attribute data definitions for a SOC Tracking polygon layer and it is anticipated to contain other point, line or polygon layers in the future, as the business area evolves. This data is published to the BCGW from an operational database edited by a web mapping application.
1. **Objectives:** The objective of this container is to store and publish preliminary SOC assessment data such as the location and results of site specific assessments or territorial worksheets. This data will allow cross-agency access to existing assessments to facilitate corporate consistency between authors. The data is highly sensitive and requires named-user level security restrictions.
1. **Summary:** This container holds all secured data models and data related to preliminary strength of claim (SOC) assessments. The data will ensure corporate access to information required to support assessment consistency when discharging the Provinces duty to consult with first nations.

**Responsibility of**: DataBC project lead spatial data administrator

### Data Modelling Completed and Approved

If the delivery includes new database objects or makes changes to existing warehouse database objects, the Logical and Physical models must be reviewed and approved by [DataBC DA](mailto:databc.da@gov.bc.ca) prior to submitting the [_Delivery Kit_](#the-delivery-kit).

**Responsibility of**: Vendor delivery personnel and DataBC project lead spatial data administrator

## THE DELIVERY KIT

### Structure and Location

All delivery kit source code is hosted in the following [_Gogs repository_](https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets).  _Delivery Kit_ packages are available to view from this site as examples to follow. 

The _Delivery Kit_ structure and content will vary depending on the specifics of the delivery. The following is a generic example file and directory structure for a non-GSR (Geographic Sites Registry) delivery:

```
    https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/xyz_whse/src/branch/master/setup/<container_name>.<version#>.README
    https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/xyz_whse/src/branch/master/<schema_name>/ddl/
    https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/xyz_whse/src/branch/master/<schema_name>/scripts/
    https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/xyz_whse/src/branch/master/<schema_name>/dataload/
    https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/xyz_whse/src/branch/master/<schema_name>/revert_to_previous/
```
GSR delivery kits have a specific structure, since the master branch of the Gogs repository for GSR contains delivery kits for all of the GSR occupant types.The following is a generic example file ad directory structure for a GSR delivery:
```
    https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/gsr_whse/src/branch/master/setup/gsr_whse.N.N.N.README
    https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/gsr_whse/src/branch/master/WHSE_IMAGERY_AND_BASE_MAPS/n.n.n_<occupant type label>/dataload
    https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/gsr_whse/src/branch/master/WHSE_IMAGERY_AND_BASE_MAPS/n.n.n_<occupant type label>/ddl
    https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/gsr_whse/src/branch/master/WHSE_IMAGERY_AND_BASE_MAPS/n.n.n_<occupant type label>/scripts
    https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/gsr_whse/src/branch/master/WHSE_IMAGERY_AND_BASE_MAPS/n.n.n_<occupant type label>/revert_to_previous
```
The following is a specific example of the file structure of a Delivery Kit for a simple release:

```
    https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/emrg_whse/src/branch/master/setup/emrg_whse.1.2.0.readme    
    https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/emrg_whse/src/branch/master/WHSE_HUMAN_CULTURAL_ECONOMIC/dataload/
    https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/emrg_whse/src/branch/master/WHSE_HUMAN_CULTURAL_ECONOMIC/scripts/
    https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/emrg_whse/src/branch/master/WHSE_HUMAN_CULTURAL_ECONOMIC/ddl/
    https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/emrg_whse/src/branch/master/WHSE_HUMAN_CULTURAL_ECONOMIC/revert_to_previous/

```

Note that a delivery kit might pertain to multiple BCGW schemas:

```
    https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/gba_whse/src/branch/master/setup/gba_whse.1.0.7.readme    
    https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/gba_whse/src/branch/master/WHSE_BASEMAPPING/dataload
    https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/gba_whse/src/branch/master/WHSE_BASEMAPPING/ddl
    https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/gba_whse/src/branch/master/WHSE_BASEMAPPING/scripts
    https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/gba_whse/src/branch/master/WHSE_BASEMAPPING/revert_to_previous
    https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/gba_whse/src/branch/master/WHSE_LEGAL_ADMIN_BOUNDARIES/dataload
    https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/gba_whse/src/branch/master/WHSE_LEGAL_ADMIN_BOUNDARIES/ddl
    https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/gba_whse/src/branch/master/WHSE_LEGAL_ADMIN_BOUNDARIES/scripts
    https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/gba_whse/src/branch/master/WHSE_LEGAL_ADMIN_BOUNDARIES/revert_to_previous

```
#### Readme file

The data delivery _readme file_ describes the contents of the _Delivery Kit_ is required with every delivery.

Each _readme_ must:

+ contain instructions for when to request execution of DataBC readme steps and from whom to request them. 
+ specify the version number of the DataBC container, which will likely be different from Ministry application release number (operational system source).
+ specify the order that scripts are to be run by the DataBC Delivery Specialist.
+ include instructions on how to rollback any changes caused by the delivery.


Note that database spatial objects are registered with the Geodatabase through ArcCatalog. For each database object to be registered, the _readme file_ should indicate:

+ the spatial data type: Point, Line, or Polygon (note that point features classes are not to be registered as multipart, unless they truly are multipoint (i.e., multiple locations per feature).
+ objectid column name (normally OBJECTID).
+ geometry column name (normally SHAPE, but might be GEOMETRY).
+ spatial reference id (normally 3005 (BC Albers), but datasets that cover much more than just BC should be registered with spatial reference is 4326 (Unprojected Longitude/Latitude in decimal degrees).
 
If the feature class being deployed to the BCGW obtains its data from an operational system administered by an “Information Management Branch” (IMB), an access account must be in place prior deploying to Delivery. Information on the process for requesting and creating such accounts lies with each IMB that operates the source application. Please contact the business area Business Analyst (BA) or Business Portfolio Manager (BPM) for more information.

A template readme file can be found in gogs:
+ for [_other than GSR_](https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/templates/src/branch/master/delivery_kit/xyz_WHSE/setup/xyz_whse.N.N.N.README) dataloads
+ for [_GSR_](https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/templates/src/branch/master/delivery_kit/gsr_whse/setup/gsr_whse.N.N.N.README ) dataloads

File name: xyz_whse.n.n.n.README = The Readme files for delivering xyz_whse version n.n.n

#### `scripts` Directory

With the exception of DDL files (to create/modify/delete/grant, etc. objects) and DML files needed as part of the data population, any other SQL files or DOS batch files needed to perform the delivery should be stored in the scripts directory.  

This directory should contain a script with the name of the form **_container_name_compute_mdsys_extents.sql_** (e.g., gba_whse_compute_mdsys_extents.sql) to set the MDSYS.user_sdo_geom_metadata diminfo column for the objects loaded by the delivery kit.  A template for this file can be found in [_gogs_](https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/templates/src/branch/master/delivery_kit/xyz_whse/WHSE_SCHEMA_NAME/scripts/xyz_whse_compute_mdsys_extents.sql).

Special scripts for adding and removing MDSYS.user_sdo_geom_metadata rows should not be needed, as registering tables/views with the geodatabase and dropping tables/views using ArcCatalog will add and remove MDSYS records as appropriate.

#### `ddl` Directory

The ddl should contain all sql files needed to create, modify, or grant access to the database objects that are part of the delivery.

There should be one file called
```
    <container_name>.sql
```
that is responsible for calling all of the other files in the directory, if there are any. There will normally be other SQL files in the same directory.

__Note that all deletions of database objects must be done in ArcCatalog.__

#### `dataload` Directory

The `/dataload/` directory contains necessary FME scripts that are used to do initial data population and are subsequently scheduled for on-going replication by DataBC ETL.

Template fmw's can be found in gogs:
+ for [_other than GSR_](https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/templates/src/branch/master/delivery_kit/xyz_whse/WHSE_SCHEMA_NAME/dataload/bcgw_table_name_staging_csv_bcgw.fmw) dataloads
+ for [_GSR_](https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/templates/src/branch/master/delivery_kit/gsr_whse/WHSE_IMAGERY_AND_BASE_MAPS/N.N.N_descriptive_name_of_release/dataload/gsr_zzz_sv_staging_csv_bcgw.fmw) dataloads

Links:
+ [_Using the DataBC FME Framework_](dpw_bcgw_w_databc_fme.md)

**Additional Notes:**

+ Please ensure the source data is in the correct location (i.e. the assigned directory on BCGW Staging or the BC Data Catalogue).
+ Within the FME script, be sure to set the ‘Target Warehouse Feature Class’ ‘Truncate Table First’ property to Yes
+ ‘Workspace Properties’ should contain the usual Header type information about your script
+ If reading from the staging area, refer to the "read-only" version (\\data.bcgov\data_staging_ro\BCGW)

See [_Data Replication Standards and Guidelines_](dps_bcgw_data_replication.md)

#### `revert_to_previous` Directory

The `/revert_to_previous/` directory should contain all sql files needed to create, modify, or grant access to the database objects as they existed at the start of the delivery.

**Note that all deletions of database objects must be done in ArcCatalog.**

-----------------------

## DATA DELIVERY PROCESS

The following process should be followed in order to ensure a smooth delivery.

### Validate the delivery kit in BCGW Delivery

It is the Vendor Delivery Personnel’s responsibility to test all components of the Delivery Kit to ensure they will deploy as expected when the migration to Test is undertaken by the DataBC Delivery Specialist. The Delivery environment is set up as a sandbox for this reason. It is vitally important that the Vendor Delivery Personnel confirm all instructions in the readme file to ensure their accuracy and correctness.

It is expected that the Vendor Delivery Personnel will ensure that a method to rollback the release (Uninstall Instructions) is clearly documented as part of the Delivery Instructions (readme). The absence of these instructions might delay or cancel the deployment of the release.

Once the Vendor Delivery Personnel has successfully tested all scripts (including those associated with reverting to the previous version), the Delivery Kit is created and the pull request has been accepted for deployment to Test and subsequent deployment to Production by the DataBC Delivery Specialist.

### Submit the delivery kit to DataBC for QA

Once all components of the Delivery Kit have been proven to work, and the file prepared and named appropriately, they must be transferred to DataBC. Transfer of release package files to the DataBC is done by submitting a GoGS pull request.  See [_GoGS Instructions for Vendors_](https://gogs.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/templates/src/branch/master/delivery_kit/Gogs_Instructions_For_Vendors.md) for more information.

### Schedule the Delivery

Prior to any data delivery to Test, scheduling of the delivery should be discussed between the Business Area Data Manager, BA/BPM, and the Vendor Delivery Personnel. Once a target date is set, the BA/BPM is responsible for scheduling the delivery date with the DataBC DA Team. Deliveries are scheduled on a “first come, first served basis”. Thus the BA/BPM may wish to determine available delivery dates in consultation with the DataBC DA Team before committing to a delivery date with the vendor.

### Deploy to TEST

Once the DataBC Delivery Specialist deploys the Delivery Kit to Test, the DataBC Spatial Data Administrator or DataBC ETL Specialist will load data as required. Notification will be sent to the Business Area Data Manager, BA/BPM, and Vendor Delivery Personnel that the migration has been completed.

### QA Data in TEST

Data verification in Test includes the high level testing or review of data to ensure completeness of the delivery. Responsibility for this activity is shared by the DataBC DA Team, Business Area Data Manager, and Vendor Delivery Personnel. The goal of this phase is to ensure that the delivery includes all of the expected data and its attributes.

### Approve Migration to PRODUCTION

Upon completion of data verification in Test, both the Business Area Data Manager, and Vendor Delivery Personnel should be satisfied that the data is available as expected. At this point, the Business Area Data Manager must notify the DataBC DA Team and the BA/BPM that the data is ready to be migrated to the Production environment.

### Deploy to PRODUCTION

Once the DataBC Delivery Specialist deploys the Delivery Kit to Production, the DataBC Spatial Data Administrator or DataBC ETL Specialist will load data as required. Notification will be sent to the Business Area Data Manager, BA/BPM, and Vendor Delivery Personnel that the migration has been completed.

### QA Data in PRODUCTION

One final data review in Production is required before the process can be considered complete. Responsibility for this activity is shared by the DataBC DA Team, Business Area Data Manager, and Vendor Delivery Personnel. The goal of this phase is to ensure that the delivery includes all of the expected data and its attributes. Upon completion of data verification in Production, both the Business Area Data Manager, and Vendor Delivery Personnel should be satisfied that the data is available as expected. At this point, the Business Area Data Manager must notify the DataBC DA Team and the BA/BPM that the data is complete in the Production environment.

### Next steps

Once the data load to PRODUCTION is complete, a number of configuration activities must take place. A separate process document covers the details of the configuration but typical tasks include:

+ Presentation Layer Files
+ Metadata record(s) (Data Catalogue Service)
+ Web Map Service (WMS) configuration
+ Distribution
+ Open Data
+ iMapBC

## APPENDIX: WORKFLOW FOR CREATING AND DELETING BCGW DATABASE OBJECTS

This section provides best practices for creating and deleting spatial database objects as part of a data delivery (publication) to the BC Geographic Warehouse.

### Prepare the Delivery Kit DDL scripts

There are two options to choose from when preparing the delivery kit DLL scripts.  

#### Option 1: Starting by Building a Physical Model

1. Using Oracle Designer, transform and export modelled spatial objects into the appropriate DDL files to be included in the delivery kit. Follow the standards defined in [Naming and Describing Standards](naming_and_describing.md) and [Data Guidance and Best Practices](data_guidance_and_best_practices.md). 

#### Option 2: Starting by Building Database Objects and Reverse-Engineering

1. Using a filled-in [Dataset log file](), copy and paste the column definitions into a DDL-generation spreadsheet available [here]().  
1. Copy and clean up the content in the generated tabs into a single SQL file.  There should be one file per database table or view. Ensure that the DDL files include GRANT statements. Change any occurrences of SDO_GEOMETRY to NUMBER.  Run the SQL file(s) in BCGW DELIVERY to make sure there are no errors.  
1. Using Oracle Designer Design Editor, reverse-engineer the DDL files into the appropriate Designer container.  Reverse engineer tables before views.
1. If necessary, correct any definitions of constraints and triggers, column and table comments, etc.  Make sure that SHAPE and/or GEOMETRY column data types are changed back to SDO_GEOMETRY.
1. Generate DDL files as in Option 1.

### Write the Data Loading Script

See [Data Replication Standards and Guidelines](data_replication_standards_and_guidelines.md) for guidance on building FME scripts.

### Write the Script for Managing the MDSYS USER_SDO_GEOM_METADATA View

See [Data Guidance and Best Practices](data_guidance_and_best_practices.md#user_sdo_geom_metadata).  

### Write the README file

A template for the README file is available [here]() for Geographic Sites Registry (GSR) publications and [here]() for all other BCGW publications.

### Test the README file (including rollback instructions) in BCGW Delivery

Before submitting a delivery kit to the DataBC program, make sure that you have tested it in the BCGW delivery environment.
