# Audience

These staging area standards are addressed specifically to:

+ people providing data content to the BC Geographic Warehouse,
+ developers providing data models and files as part of the DataBC delivery kit publication process,
+ developers describing web services that are consumed by DataBC processes (e.g., a JSON REST service consumed by a DataBC Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes),
+ DataBC staff who review data models and review draft BC Data Catalogue records.

# Purpose

DataBC manages multiple staging areas to allow for the transfer and storage of file based source datasets for the intent to be published via DataBC's access channels.

+ BC Geographic Warehouse (BCGW)
+ BC Data Catalogue (BCDC)
+ Tilecache

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## AGO (ArcGIS ONLINE) STAGING AREA LOCATION AND ACCESS

+ This is a public facing web enabled location.
+ It is intended for use by [_BCs Map Hub_](https://governmentofbc.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html) "content creators" who require URLs for files to be used in ArcGIS Online applications.
+ Files types located in this area should be restricted to images or documents (i.e. png, jpg, pdfs).
+ Data is not permitted to be hosted in this area.
+ Location: \\data.bcgov\agol_staging\
+ Directory access requests are to be submitted through [_Map Services_](faq.md#map-services) team.  Note: IDIR Access to this location is usually provided to content creators during setup of their BCs Map Hub account.
+ Usage notes.  The exact path+file extension must be referenced to access from web:
   + for this folder location \\data.bcgov\agol_staging\[add remaining file path here]
   + the URL is: https://pub.data.gov.bc.ca/ago/ (add remaining file path here - including the file name and extension you wish to access)
   + Example:  BC Geocoder and Route Planner WAB app demo
      + \\data.bcgov\agol_staging\resources\apps\widgetDemo\index.html
      + https://pub.data.gov.bc.ca/ago/resources/apps/WidgetDemo/index.html

## BCGW STAGING AREA LOCATION AND ACCESS

+ The Staging Area is only accessible via the GTS Servers.
+ When uploading datasets to Staging, directories are to be mapped as:
   + \\data.bcgov\data_staging_bcgw\
   + The second level of the [_Data Classification Hierarchy_](data_classification_hierarchy.md#data-classification-hierarchy) is used to determine what folder the data is to be located in. 
      + This location will be assigned by DataBC DA.
+ Directory access requests are to be submitted through [Data Architecture Services](mailto:DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca)

[RETURN TO TOP][1] 

-----------------------------------------------------------

## BC DATA CATALOGUE AS A STAGING AREA FOR THE BCGW

+  The BC Data Catalogue (BCDC) is accessible to all IDIRs who are authorized on behalf of their branch or suborg to manage their data holdings.
  https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/
+ Data intended for the BCGW and stored within BCDC's file store, are tabular with coordinate values that can be projected into point locations.
+ To acquire accounts for BCDC contact [_BC Data Catalogue Services_](faq.md#bc-data-catalogue-services) team
+ To publish data to the BCGW contact [Data Architecture Services](mailto:DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca)

[RETURN TO TOP][1] 

-----------------------------------------------------------

## DBC STAGING AREA LOCATION AND ACCESS

+ The DBC Staging Area is only accessible via the GTS Servers and to a small set of users.
+ When uploading datasets to DBC Staging, directories are to be mapped as:
   + \\data.bcgov\data_staging_dbc\
+ Directory access requests are to be submitted through [Data Architecture Services](mailto:DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca)

[RETURN TO TOP][1] 

-----------------------------------------------------------

## TILECACHE STAGING AREA LOCATION AND ACCESS

+ This staging area is only accessible to those who are part of creating the tilecache.
+ DataBC Webmapping manages and provides access.
+ Files in this directory must meet the requirements as with any other published files.
   + One acceptation is that all feature classes will be stored in a single FGDB per tilecache.
+ For more information, contact [_Map Services_](faq.md#map-services) team.

-----------------------------------------------------------

## STAGING AREA REQUIREMENTS

+ ArcGIS Geodatabases are required to be created in version 10.2 or earlier.
+ Datasets should be directly in the hierarchy directory, not in a sub folder of its own
+ Datasets should be in their final published form.
+ Datasets in the Staging directories are for read only, i.e., no in-place editing.
+ Do not use the Staging directories for backing-up your datasets. 
+ For formal archiving of datasets, please use your organizationâ€™s standards and processes.

[RETURN TO TOP][1] 

-----------------------------------------------------------

## STAGING AREA NAMING AND DATA QUALITY

+ Datasets are required to have valid geometries set at the standard tolerances and precision. Please use Check and/or Repair geometry tools prior to uploading to Staging.
+ It is imperative the naming and structure of each participating dataset remain constant; as well, Geodatabase names should conform to naming standards as provided in:
 https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/data/geographic/bcgw/file_geodatabase_standards.pdf
