## Creating an Open Government Licence

The Broader Public Sector (BPS) is not permitted to use the OGL-BC and thus must create their own. These are suggested steps to create an Open Government Licence for your organization:

1. Copy our [Open Government Licence - British Columbia](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A519A56BC2BF44E4A008B33FCF527F61), as it is consistent with Federal and other Local Governments
	+ examples: [**BC Assessment**](https://info.bcassessment.ca/pages/opengovernmentlicencebcassessment.aspx) and [**Elections BC**](https://www.elections.bc.ca/docs/EBC-Open-Data-Licence.pdf)
1. Modify the identified text to personalize it for your org
	1. **Licence Name** change:
		+ _‘Open Government License – British Columbia’_ to
		+ _‘Open Government License – BC Oil and Gas Commission’_
			+ This name should be the same that is found on the BC List of Agencies, Crown Corps, etc
	1. Change line:
		+ _‘Contains information licensed under the Open Government Licence – British Columbia.’_ to
		+ _‘Contains information licensed under the Open Government Licence – BC Oil and Gas Commission’_.
	1. **Information Provider** change:
		+_‘means Her Majesty the Queen in right of the Province of British Columbia.’_ to
		+ ‘means BC Oil and Gas Commission.’_
	1. **Versioning** change:
		+ _‘This is version 2.0 of the Open Government Licence for Government of British Columbia Information.’_ to
		+ _‘This is version 1.0 of the Open Government Licence for BC Oil and Gas Commission Information.’_
	1. **Note**: remove section on BC Government Copyright or whole line:
		+ _'Note: as per B.C. Government Copyright, the following licence only applies to records in the B.C. Data Catalogue that specify it.'_
1. Publish the OGL to a public site so that it can add it to the drop down list of licence options.
